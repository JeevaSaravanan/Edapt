### 🎧 How to Play

#### Option 1: Quick Play Script
```bash
cd /Users/jeevasaravanabhavanandam/Documents/Edapt/server/tts_agent
./play_narration.sh
```

#### Option 2: Direct Command
```bash
afplay /Users/jeevasaravanabhavanandam/Documents/Edapt/media/audio/narration/derivative_narration_full.mp3
```

#### Option 3: Open in Finder
```bash
open /Users/jeevasaravanabhavanandam/Documents/Edapt/media/audio/narration/
```

### 🎬 Next Steps: Integrate with Manim Video

Now that you have the audio, you can add it to your derivative explanation video!

#### Method 1: Render with Audio (Recommended)

Add the audio during manim render:

```bash
cd /Users/jeevasaravanabhavanandam/Documents/Edapt

manim -pqh server/animation_manim/manim-sample.py DerivativeExplanation \
  --add_audio media/audio/narration/derivative_narration_full.mp3
```

#### Method 2: Add Audio in Manim Scene

Edit your manim scene to include audio:

```python
# In server/animation_manim/manim-sample.py
class DerivativeExplanation(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Add narration audio
        self.add_sound("../../media/audio/narration/derivative_narration_full.mp3")
        
        # Your existing animation code...
        title = Text("Understanding Derivatives", font_size=48)
        # ... rest of your code
```

#### Method 3: Post-Production in Video Editor

1. Export manim video without audio:
   ```bash
   manim -qh server/animation_manim/manim-sample.py DerivativeExplanation
   ```

2. Import both files into video editor (iMovie, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve)

3. Sync audio with video manually for perfect timing

### 📝 Narration Timeline Reference

Use this to sync animations with audio segments:

| Time | Segment | Content |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0:00-0:03 | Title Screen | "Welcome to Understanding Derivatives..." |
| 0:04-0:08 | Axes & Graph | "Here we have a simple function..." |
| 0:09-0:13 | Secant Line Intro | "Let's start with something familiar..." |
| 0:14-0:18 | Two Points | "The slope of this secant line..." |
| 0:19-0:22 | Beginning Animation | "But here's where it gets interesting..." |
| 0:23-0:30 | Points Getting Closer | "Watch carefully. As the distance..." |
| 0:31-0:35 | Tangent Line | "There! When the distance becomes..." |
| 0:36-0:42 | Derivative Formula | "This process of taking the limit..." |
| 0:43-0:48 | Specific Example | "For our function, x squared..." |
| 0:49-0:54 | Geometric Interpretation | "The derivative tells us..." |
| 0:55-1:10 | Moving Dot | "Now watch as we move along..." |
| 1:11-1:16 | Conclusion | "This is the power of derivatives..." |

### 🔄 Generate More Variations

Want different versions? You can easily generate more:

#### Slower Version (for study)
```python
from google_tts_agent import GoogleTTSAgent

agent = GoogleTTSAgent()
agent.set_voice(name="en-US-Neural2-J", gender="MALE")
agent.set_audio_config(speaking_rate=0.80, pitch=-1.0)  # Much slower
agent.text_to_speech(
    get_full_narration_text(),
    "media/audio/narration/derivative_narration_slow.mp3"
)
```

#### Female Voice Version
```python
agent.set_voice(name="en-US-Neural2-F", gender="FEMALE")
agent.set_audio_config(speaking_rate=0.92, pitch=0.0)
agent.generate_narration_audio(
    output_dir="media/audio/narration",
    mode="full"
)
```

#### Individual Segments (for editing flexibility)
```bash
cd /Users/jeevasaravanabhavanandam/Documents/Edapt/server/tts_agent
python -c "
from google_tts_agent import GoogleTTSAgent
agent = GoogleTTSAgent()
agent.set_voice(name='en-US-Neural2-J', gender='MALE')
agent.set_audio_config(speaking_rate=0.92, pitch=-0.5)
agent.generate_narration_audio(
    output_dir='../../media/audio/narration_segments',
    mode='segments'
)
"
```

This will create 12 separate MP3 files, one for each narration segment.

### 📊 Cost Information

This generation cost approximately **$0.03** using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech:
- Characters: 1,739
- Neural2 voice: $16 per 1 million characters
- Cost: (1,739 / 1,000,000) × $16 = $0.028

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

#### Can't hear audio?
```bash
# Check audio file
afinfo media/audio/narration/derivative_narration_full.mp3
```

#### Want to re-generate?
```bash
cd server/tts_agent
python generate-narration.py
```

#### Need different voice?
Edit `generate-narration.py` and change the voice name. See available voices:
```python
from google_tts_agent import GoogleTTSAgent
agent = GoogleTTSAgent()
voices = agent.list_available_voices()
for v in voices[:10]:
    print(f"{v['name']} - {v['gender']}")
```

### 🎓 Tips for Best Results

1. **Listen First**: Play the audio to ensure quality before video editing
2. **Sync Carefully**: Use the timeline reference above for precise sync
3. **Test Different Speeds**: Try 0.85x or 1.0x to see what works best
4. **Export High Quality**: Use `-qh` flag in manim for production
5. **Backup**: Keep the original audio file for future use
